Easy::jit: A just-in-time compiler for C++
==========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmmartinez/easy-just-in-time.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmmartinez/easy-just-in-time)

About
-----

Easy::jit is a _compiler-assisted_ library that enables simple Just-In-Time
code generation for C++ codes.

### Talks
 
* [Easy::jit at FOSDEM'18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_rydTiB32I)

Building
--------

First, install clang and LLVM.

```bash
apt install llvm-5.0-dev llvm-5.0-tools clang-5.0
```

Then, configure and compile the project.

```bash
cmake -DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-5.0/cmake <path_to_easy_jit_src>
cmake --build .
```

To build the examples, install the [opencv](https://opencv.org/) library, 
and add the flags ```-DEASY_JIT_EXAMPLE=1``` to the cmake command.

To enable benchmarking, install the [google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) framework, 
and add the flags ```-DEASY_JIT_BENCHMARK=1 -DBENCHMARK_DIR=<path_to_google_benchmark_install>``` to the cmake command.

Everything is ready to go!

Basic usage
-----------

### Compiling my project with Easy::Jit

Since the Easy::Jit library relies on assistance from the compiler, its
mandatory to load a compiler plugin in order to use it.
The flag ```-Xclang -load -Xclang <path_to_easy_jit_build>/bin/EasyJitPass.so```
loads the plugin.

The included headers require C++14 support, and remember to add the include directories!
Use ```--std=c++14 -I<path_to_easy_jit_src>/cpplib/include```.

Finaly, the binary must be linked against the Easy::Jit runtime library, using
```-L<path_to_easy_jit_build>/bin -lEasyJitRuntime```.

Putting all together we get the command bellow.

```bash
clang++-5.0 --std=c++14 <my_file.cpp> \
  -Xclang -load -Xclang /path/to/easy/jit/build/bin/bin/EasyJitPass.so \
  -I<path_to_easy_jit_src>/cpplib/include \
  -L<path_to_easy_jit_build>/bin -lEasyJitRuntime
```

### Using Easy::Jit inside my project

Consider the code below from a software that applies image filters on a video stream.
In the following sections we are going to adapt it to use the Easy::jit library.
The function to optimize is ```kernel```, which applies a mask on the entire image.

The mask, its dimensions and area do not change often, so specializing the function for
these parameters seems reasonable.
Moreover, the image dimensions and number of channels typically remain constant during
the entire execution; however, it is impossible to know their values as they depend on the stream.

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp ORIGINAL/>
```

The main header for the library is ```easy/jit.h```, where the only core function
of the library is exported. This function is called -- guess how? -- ```easy::jit```.
We add the corresponding include directive them in the top of the file.

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp INCLUDE_EASY/>
```

With the call to ```easy::jit```, we specialize the function and obtain a new
one taking only two parameters (the input and the output frame).

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp EASY/>
```

#### Deducing which functions to expose at runtime

Easy::jit embeds the [LLVM bitcode](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html)
representation of the functions to specialize at runtime in the binary code.
To perform this, the library requires access to the implementation of these
functions.
Easy::jit does an effort to deduce which functions are specialized at runtime,
still in many cases this is not possible.

In this case, it's possible to use the ```EASY_JIT_EXPOSE``` macro, as shown in
the following code,

```cpp
void EASY_JIT_EXPOSE kernel() { /* ... */ }
```

or using a regular expression during compilation.
The command bellow exports all functions whose name starts with "^kernel".

```bash
clang++ ... -mllvm -easy-export="^kernel.*"  ...
```

#### Caching

In parallel to the ```easy/jit.h``` header, there is ```easy/code_cache.h``` which
provides a code cache to avoid recompilation of functions that already have been
generated.

Bellow we show the code from previous section, but adapted to use a code cache.

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp INCLUDE_EASY_CACHE/>
```

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp EASY_CACHE/>
```
